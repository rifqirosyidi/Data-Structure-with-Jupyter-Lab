Understanding data-structure using python and jupyter lab
- cool

# Issue
Getting the message "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?" when viewing an *.ipynb on a GitHub blob page.

Probably a problem with the GitHub notebook viewing tool - sometimes github fails to render the ipynb notebooks, 
I believe that is some temporary (and recurring) issue with their backend

A workaround

Try to open that notebook that you want using nbviewer online, you don't need to install it.

Open ("https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/")

Copy link some notebook .ipynb file , (e.g. "https://github.com/rifqirosyidi/data-structure-with-jupyter-lab/blob/master/queue_stack_heaps/stack_last_in_first_out.ipynb") 

Paste to ("https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/")
